## Welcome to Eisvana!

Eisvana is a civilization, a player-created community in the game [No Man's Sky](https://www.nomanssky.com/).

The tools hosted here are specifically geared towards Eisvana, but can be forked and adjusted to fit other civs as well.

## Apps

You can find all of our apps on our [Government Portal](https://eisvana.github.io/)

Freedom is one of our core values. This also applies to our software. All of our apps respect your freedom to enjoy the web without being tracked or monitored, meaning they do not collect any data about you, at all. Our apps and code are freely available. "Free" as in "freedom" and as in "no cost". Anyone can fork our apps and use them as a base for their own projects.
